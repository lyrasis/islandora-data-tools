= get_techmd_datastreams.rb

`ruby get_techmd_datastreams.rb -p {local_port} -i {input_file} -o {output_directory}`

`input_file`:: path to text file listing PIDs of objects whose datastreams you want to get (`namespace:id`), one per line.
`output_directory`:: path to directory where you want individual results files to be saved.

Output will be:

- one XML file per TECHMD datastream successfully retrieved: `namespace-id.xml`
- list of objects in your list lacking a TECHMD datastream: `no_techmd.txt`
- list of objects where TECHMD datastream was not retrieved for some reason: `errs.txt`. Can be used as input to a subsequent run of the script.
- log with more info about items in errs.txt, if it was available: `get_techmd_datastreams.log`
