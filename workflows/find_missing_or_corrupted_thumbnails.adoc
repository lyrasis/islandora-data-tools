= Find missing or corrupted thumbnails

== Find missing thumbnails

Use a Solr query to identify objects for which a TN derivative was not created.

This example query will search the entire repository for objects without thumbnails. It returns the PID of any objects missing a thumbnail, a list of the datastreams the object _does_ have, the object's content model, and the collection(s) of which the object is a member. 

http://localhost:9876/solr/collection1/select?q=-fedora_datastreams_ms%3ATN&fl=PID,fedora_datastreams_ms,RELS_EXT_hasModel_uri_ms,RELS_EXT_isMemberOfCollection_uri_ms


== Find blank/corrupted thumbnails

This process is handled via a list of object PIDs.

* Download output file from migration server to your machine
* Open as CSV and sort by filesize, looking for 0 byte or other extremely small files
