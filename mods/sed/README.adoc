= sed one-liners for quick MODS fixes

Sometimes the easiest and quickest fix is a find/replace from the command line using https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html[sed].

*In-place find-replace in all MODS in a directory*

Destructive, so backup the files before, or be ready to re-generate/re-download them if you mess up.

`cd \into\directory\containing\mods`

`sed -i 's/find this/replace it with this/g' *.xml`

If you need to find/replace strings that contain `/`, you can do something like:

`sed -i 's%find this/that%replace it with this%g' *.xml`
