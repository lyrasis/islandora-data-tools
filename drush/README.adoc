`drush` scripts

Discuss authorization/permission requirements with whoever administers your Islandora instance.

I don't think `drush` allows passing arguements through with `php-script`, so you will need to edit input/output locations and variables directly in the scripts. See each script's README for details. 

Usage (may vary depending on your setup):

`drush -u {userid} @{sitealias} php-script {path/to/script}`
