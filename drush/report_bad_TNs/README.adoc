== in-script variables to customize

`$input`:: full path to text file containing one PID per line. PIDs should be in the format: `namespace:ID`.
`$output`:: full path to directory in which you'd like output written. Output is a tab-delimited text file with two columns: pid, and TN datastream filesize. If there is no TN datastream, it says 'empty' instead of the filesize.
