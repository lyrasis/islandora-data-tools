= get_list_datastreams.php

== in-script variables to customize

`$pids`:: full path to text file containing PIDs of objects for which you want to grab the objects (`namespace:id`)
`$savedir`:: full path to directory where datastreams will be saved
`$dsid`:: dsid of datastream to download


WARNING: Currently only OBJ datastream for PDFs is supported. Adding another datastream or file type will require updating the `get_suffix` function, but this is trivial!
