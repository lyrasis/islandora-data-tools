= get_list_datastreams.php

== in-script variables to customize

`$pids`:: full path to text file containing PIDs of objects for which you want to grab the objects (`namespace:id`)
`$savedir`:: full path to directory where datastreams will be saved
`$dsid`:: dsid of datastream to download


[IMPORTANT]
====
*Currently only MODS, TECHMD, and OBJ datastreams are supported.* Adding another datastream type will require updating the `get_and_write_datastream` function with the correct file suffix.

*Currently only PDF OBJ datastream download is supported.* Adding another datastream or file type will require updating the `get_suffix` function.

These updates are trivial to make.
